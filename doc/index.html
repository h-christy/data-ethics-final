In this volume, contributors explore the limits of toleration and suggest we think beyond them to mutual respect. Salman Rushdie reflects on the once tolerant Sufi-Hindu culture of Kashmir. Ira Katznelson follows with an intellectual history of toleration as a layered institution in the West. Charles Taylor advances a new approach to secularism in our multicultural world, and Akeel Bilgrami responds by offering context and caution to that approach. Nadia Urbinati explores why Cicero’s humanist ideal of Concord was not used in response to religious discord. The volume concludes with a refutation of the claim that toleration was invented in the West. Rajeev Bhargava writes on Asoka’s India, and Karen Barkey explores toleration within the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stephen Smale: The Mathematician Who Broke the Dimension Barrier: The Mathematician Who Broke the Dimension Barrier;,citation_abstract=In 1957 Stephen Smale startled the mathematical world by showing that, in a theoretical sense, it is possible to turn a sphere inside out. A few years later, from the beaches of Rio, he introduced the horseshoe map, demonstrating that simple functions could have chaotic dynamics. His next stunning mathematical accomplishment was to solve the higher-dimensional Poincare conjecture, thus demonstrating that higher dimensions are simpler than the more familiar three. In 1966 in Moscow, he was awarded the Fields Medal, the most prestigious prize in mathematics. Smale’s vision and influence extended beyond mathematics into two vastly different realms. In 1965 in Berkeley, he initiated a program with Jerry Rubin of civil disobedience directed at ending the Vietnam War. And as a mineral collector, he accumulated a museum-quality collection that ranks among the finest in the world. Despite these diverse accomplishments, Smale’s name is virtually unknown outside mathematics and mineral collecting. One of the objectives of this book is to bring his life and work to the attention of a larger community. There are few good biographies of mathematicians. This makes sense when considering that to place their lives in perspective requires some appreciation of their theorems. Biographical writers are not usually trained in mathematics, and mathematicians do not usually write biographies. Though the author, Steve Batterson, is primarily a mathematician, he has long been intrigued by the notion of working on a biography of Smale. In this book, Batterson records and makes known the life and accomplishments of this great mathematician and significant figure in intellectual history.;,citation_author=Steve Batterson;,citation_publication_date=2012-12;,citation_cover_date=2012-12;,citation_year=2012;,citation_isbn=978-0-8218-2696-6;,citation_language=en-US;">

Major conclusions are these: (1) there has been an average increase of about 23% in tolerant responses; (2) about 4% of this increase is due to cohort effects on educational attainment, as Stouffer predicted; (3) about 5% is due to cohort repalcement per se; (4) about 13% is due to increasing tolerance among all cohort and education groups, the opposite of what Stouffer predicted; and (5) about 1% is due to increased college attainment not accounted for by cohort.;,citation_author=James A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monopsony and Employer Mis-optimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers;,citation_abstract=We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibits considerable bunching at round numbers that cannot be explained by rounding of survey respondents. We consider two explanations—worker left-digit bias and employer optimization frictions. We experimentally rule out left-bunching by randomizing wages for an identical task on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and fail to find evidence of any discontinuity in the labor supply function as predicted by workers’ left-digit bias despite a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate the absence of round number discontinuities in firm labor supply in matched worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon as well as in an online stated preference experiment conducted with Wal-Mart workers. Further, the shape of the missing mass that accounts for the bunching at a round number exhibits none of the asymmetry predicted by worker left-digit bias. Symmetry of the missing mass distribution around the round number suggests that employer optimization frictions are more important. We show that a more monopsonistic market requires less employer mis-optimization to rationalize the bunching in the data. The extent of monopsony power implied by our estimated labor supply elasticities, which are in line with other recent studies, are consistent with a sizable amount of non-optimal bunching, with only modest losses in profits. Overall, the extent and form of round-number bunching suggests that “behavioral firms” can systematically misprice labor without being driven out of the market in the presence of monopsony power.;,citation_author=Arindrajit Dube;,citation_author=Alan Manning;,citation_author=Suresh Naidu;,citation_publication_date=2018-09;,citation_cover_date=2018-09;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.3386/w24991;,citation_publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research;,citation_series_title=Working Paper Series;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mismeasure of Man;,citation_abstract=The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve. When published in 1981, The Mismeasure of Man was immediately hailed as a masterwork, the ringing answer to those who would classify people, rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits. And yet the idea of innate limits—of biology as destiny—dies hard, as witness the attention devoted to&nbsp;The Bell Curve, whose arguments are here so effectively anticipated and thoroughly undermined by Stephen Jay Gould. In this edition Dr. Gould has written a substantial new introduction telling how and why he wrote the book and tracing the subsequent history of the controversy on innateness right through The Bell Curve. Further, he has added five essays on questions of The Bell Curve in particular and on race, racism, and biological determinism in general. These additions strengthen the book’s claim to be, as Leo J. Kamin of Princeton University has said, &amp;amp;amp;quot;a major contribution toward deflating pseudo-biological ’explanations’ of our present social woes.&amp;quot;;,citation_author=Stephen Jay Gould;,citation_publication_date=1996-02;,citation_cover_date=1996-02;,citation_year=1996;,citation_isbn=978-0-393-31425-0;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Scientist’s Guide to Writing: How to Write More Easily and Effectively throughout Your Scientific Career;,citation_abstract=The ability to write clearly is critical to any scientific career. The Scientist’s Guide to Writing provides practical advice to help scientists become more effective writers so that their ideas have the greatest possible impact. Drawing on his own experience as a scientist, graduate adviser, and editor, Stephen Heard emphasizes that the goal of all scientific writing should be absolute clarity; that good writing takes deliberate practice; and that what many scientists need are not long lists of prescriptive rules but rather direct engagement with their behaviors and attitudes when they write. He combines advice on such topics as how to generate and maintain writing momentum with practical tips on structuring a scientific paper, revising a first draft, handling citations, responding to peer reviews, managing coauthorships, and more. In an accessible, informal tone, The Scientist’s Guide to Writing explains essential techniques that students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career scientists need to write more clearly, efficiently, and easily.

The twentieth century has become &amp;amp;amp;quot;history&amp;quot; at an unprecedented rate. The world of 2007 is so utterly unlike that of even 1987, much less any earlier time, that we have lost touch with our immediate past even before we have begun to make sense of it. In less than a generation, the headlong advance of globalization, with the geographical shifts of emphasis and influence it brings in its wake, has altered the structures of thought that had been essentially unchanged since the European industrial revolution. Quite literally, we don’t know where we came from. From the history of the neglect and recovery of the Holocaust and the challenge of &quot;evil&quot; in the understanding of the European past to the rise and fall of the &quot;state&quot; in public affairs and the displacement of history by &quot;heritage,&quot; Judt takes us beyond what we think we know to show us how we came to know it and reveals how many aspects of our history have been sacrificed in the triumph of mythmaking over understanding, collective identity over truth, and denial over memory.–From amazon.com.;,citation_author=Tony Judt;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_isbn=978-0-434-01741-6;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Open Survey Questions as Measures of Personal Concern with Issues: A Reanalysis of Stouffer’s Communism, Conformity, and Civil Liberties;,citation_abstract=Answers to open survey questions, because they represent a respondent’s own words rather than a choice among preformulated responses, are often assumed to reflect concern over or involvement in an issue mentioned spontaneously. Stouffer (1955) makes such an assumption in his classic book, Communism, Conformity, and Civil Liberties, which includes both open and closed questions about the same attitude objects. The open questions are intended to assess &amp;amp;amp;quot;the depth and intensity of opinions&amp;quot; expressed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Divided armies: Inequality and battlefield performance in modern war;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;quot;How do armies fight and what makes them victorious on the modern battlefield? In Divided Armies, Jason Lyall challenges long-standing answers to this classic question by linking the fate of armies to their levels of inequality. Introducing the concept of military inequality, Lyall demonstrates how a state’s prewar choices about the citizenship status of ethnic groups within its population determine subsequent battlefield performance. Treating certain ethnic groups as second-class citizens, either by subjecting them to state-sanctioned discrimination or, worse, violence, undermines interethnic trust, fuels grievances, and leads victimized soldiers to subvert military authorities once war begins. The higher an army’s inequality, Lyall finds, the greater its rates of desertion, side-switching, casualties, and use of coercion to force these soldiers to fight. In a sweeping historical investigation, Lyall draws on Project Mars, a new dataset of 250 conventional wars fought since 1800, to test this argument. Project Mars breaks with prior efforts by including overlooked non-Western wars while cataloguing new patterns of inequality and wartime conduct across hundreds of belligerents. Combining historical comparisons and statistical analysis, Lyall also marshals evidence from nine wars, ranging from the Eastern Fronts of World War I and II to less familiar wars in Africa and Central Asia, to illustrate inequality’s effects. Sounding the alarm on the dangers of inequality, Divided Armies offers important lessons about battlefield performance over two centuries–and for wars still to come&amp;quot;– Provided by publisher.;,citation_author=Jason Lyall;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_isbn=978-0-691-19243-7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Princeton studies in international history and politics;">

Nunan argues that Afghanistan functioned as a laboratory for the future of the Third World nation-state. If, in the 1960s, Soviets, Americans, and Germans sought to make a territorial national economy for Afghanistan, later, under military occupation, Soviet nation-builders, French and Swedish humanitarians, and Pakistani-supported guerrillas fought a transnational civil war over Afghan statehood.

Challenging the idea of Islamist organizations as irreconcilably opposed to organizations like the United Nations or nation-state centric international organizations, the article shows how periodicals published by and for Iraqis and Afghans were often quite ambiguous as to whether they endorsed pan-Islamism or forms of international order based around sovereign nation-states. The article explores this ambiguity through such groups’ relationship toward ideas of pan-Islamism; international institutions like the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bretton Woods institutions; and the United Nations itself.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974;,citation_abstract=Beginning in 1945, America rocketed through a quarter-century of extraordinary economic growth, experiencing an amazing boom that soared to unimaginable heights in the 1960s. At one point, in the late 1940s, American workers produced 57 percent of the planet’s steel, 62 percent of the oil, 80 percent of the automobiles. The U.S. then had three-fourths of the world’s gold supplies. English Prime Minister Edward Heath later said that the United States in the post-War era enjoyed &amp;amp;amp;quot;the greatest prosperity the world has ever known.&amp;quot; It was a boom that produced a national euphoria, a buoyant time of grand expectations and an unprecedented faith in our government, in our leaders, and in the American dream–an optimistic spirit which would be shaken by events in the ’60s and ’70s, and particularly by the Vietnam War. Now, in Grand Expectations, James T. Patterson has written a highly readable and balanced work that weaves the major political, cultural, and economic events of the period into a superb portrait of America from 1945 through Watergate. Here is an era teeming with memorable events–from the bloody campaigns in Korea and the bitterness surrounding McCarthyism to the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, to the Vietnam War, Watergate, and Nixon’s resignation. Patterson excels at portraying the amazing growth after World War II–the great building boom epitomized by Levittown (the largest such development in history) and the baby boom (which exploded literally nine months after V-J Day)–as well as the resultant buoyancy of spirit reflected in everything from streamlined toasters, to big, flashy cars, to the soaring, butterfly roof of TWA’s airline terminal in New York. And he shows how this upbeat, can-do mood spurred grander and grander expectations as the era progressed. Of course, not all Americans shared in this economic growth, and an important thread running through the book is an informed and gripping depiction of the civil rights movement–from the electrifying Brown v. Board of Education decision, to the violent confrontations in Little Rock, Birmingham, and Selma, to the landmark civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965. Patterson also shows how the Vietnam War–which provoked LBJ’s growing credibility gap, vast defense spending that dangerously unsettled the economy, and increasingly angry protests–and a growing rights revolution (including demands by women, Hispanics, the poor, Native Americans, and gays) triggered a backlash that widened hidden rifts in our society, rifts that divided along racial, class, and generational lines. And by Nixon’s resignation, we find a national mood in stark contrast to the grand expectations of ten years earlier, one in which faith in our leaders and in the attainability of the American dream was greatly shaken.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Science and religion around the world: Compatibility between belief systems predicts increased well-being;,citation_abstract=Previous research, conducted mainly in Western societies, indicates that religious/spiritual (R/S) and pro-science belief systems each relate positively to believer well-being, but are perceived as being highly incompatible with each other. This perception would presumably undermine one’s ability to benefit fully from both systems, leading to the research questions examined here: does the perceived incompatibility between religion and science vary cross-culturally, and is this level of incompatibility itself related to group member well-being? Our data set included 55,230 participants from 54 countries, organized for analytical purposes into 13 global regions and 11 belief groups. We found that perceived incompatibility between R/S and pro-science beliefs was indeed characteristic of the West but was not the norm cross-culturally. We also found that higher levels of belief system compatibility related positively to well-being, and especially to the strength of positive associations between well-being and each type of belief system. That is, in regions and belief groups that perceived higher compatibility, well-being’s positive relationships with R/S and pro-science beliefs were both also higher. We speculate about compatibility’s potential causal effects on these relationships, noting that as compatibility increases, so does the possibility of benefiting from one system without forgoing the benefits of the other.;,citation_author=Michael E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=McCarthyism, Media, and Political Repression: Evidence from Hollywood;,citation_abstract=Demagogues have existed throughout history, yet their impact on individuals and society remains little understood. We study a far-reaching episode of demagoguery in American history. From the late 1940s to 1950s, anti-communist hysteria led by Senator Joseph McCarthy and others gripped the nation. Hollywood was a prime target, with hundreds of professionals in the industry being accused of having communist ties or sympathies. To study the Red Scare in Hollywood, we assemble a unique collection of data on individual and film characteristics, spanning the period 1930-1970. We show that the anti-communist accusations targeted progressive personalities with dissenting views. Implementing a difference-in-differences design, we find that accused actors and screenwriters experienced a significant setback in their careers that lasted a decade or more. Beyond the effects on the accused, we also document a decline in progressive films during the McCarthy era. We provide suggestive evidence that this shift in film content made society more conservative, using newly-digitized data on movie theaters across US counties. Areas with greater movie exposure saw increased Republican support in presidential elections after the onset of the Hollywood Red Scare. Our results highlight how demagoguery can suppress civil liberties and reshape political preferences in society.;,citation_author=Hui Ren Tan;,citation_author=Tianyi Wang;,citation_publication_date=2024-07;,citation_cover_date=2024-07;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.3386/w32682;,citation_publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research;,citation_series_title=Working Paper Series;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethel Rosenberg: An American Tragedy;,citation_abstract=New York Times bestselling author Anne Sebba’s moving biography of Ethel Rosenberg, the wife and mother whose execution for espionage-related crimes defined the Cold War and horrified the world.In June 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple with two young sons, were led separately from their prison cells on Death Row and electrocuted moments apart. Both had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union, despite the fact that the US government was aware that the evidence against Ethel was shaky at best and based on the perjury of her own brother.This book is the first to focus on one half of that couple in more than thirty years, and much new evidence has surfaced since then. Ethel was a bright girl who might have fulfilled her personal dream of becoming an opera singer, but instead found herself struggling with the social mores of the 1950’s. She longed to be a good wife and perfect mother, while battling the political paranoia of the McCarthy era, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and a mother who never valued her. Because of her profound love for and loyalty to her husband, she refused to incriminate him, despite government pressure on her to do so. Instead, she courageously faced the death penalty for a crime she hadn’t committed, orphaning her children.Seventy years after her trial, this is the first time Ethel’s story has been told with the full use of the dramatic and tragic prison letters she exchanged with her husband, her lawyer and her psychotherapist over a three-year period, two of them in solitary confinement. Hers is the resonant story of what happens when a government motivated by fear tramples on the rights of its citizens.;,citation_author=Anne Sebba;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_isbn=978-1-250-19865-5;,citation_language=en-US;">

But all this was a prelude to the memorable events that began in August 1948, when Chambers testified against Alger Hiss in the spy case that changed America. Whittaker Chambers goes far beyond all previous accounts of the Hiss case, re-creating its improbably twists and turns, and disentangling the motives that propelled a vivid cast of characters in unpredictable directions.

The analysis demonstrates how politicians, political parties, and voters decide who gets what, when, and how in the economic arena. A nation’s politics, it is argued, shape the most important aspects of economic life–inflation, unemployment, income redistribution, the growth of government, and the extent of central economic control. Both statistical data and case studies (based on interviews and Presidential documents) are brought to bear on four topics. They are: 1) the political manipulation of the economy in election years, 2) the new international electoral-economic cycle, 3) the decisive role of political leaders and parties in shaping macroeconomic outcomes, and 4) the response of the electorate to changing economic conditions.

<p>The state can’t implement toleration if there are no significant presence of tolerance in the community.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The term toleration is an idea of negative liberty, and involves elements of judgement<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The logic of toleration is outdated and can be seen as offensive, however, it is still operating. We would find rethinking the idea of toleration a fruitful journey. People can be driven by complicated motives and reasons to tolerate.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
